 <h2> 5 benefits of Cyber Security </h2>
 <p> Why is training so important? Here are five reasons to empower your people with the right security knowledge to protect your business:</p>
 <h2> 1. Cybersecurity – An Evergreen Industry</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity has slowly transformed into an evergreen industry. Like air pollution was a by-product of the industrial revolution, cyber attacks are a similar by-product of the digital revolution. Keeping this situation in mind, and looking at the advances we have made as a community since the invention of the internet, I think it’s an obvious conclusion that Cybersecurity as a viable career option is here to stay. With the advent of topics like Big Data, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing the permanent stature of Cybersecurity and the magnitude of its importance has been very well set in stone. So if you wish to learn cybersecurity in today’s age, it’s definitely a good idea. </p>
 <h2>2. A Career that Serves the Greater Good </h2> 
<p> Cybersecurity Companies have defended us time and time again against a variety of cyber attacks that to compromise our confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Even so, the number of cyber crimes are only increasing day by day. Millions are falling prey to phishing scams, ransomware & spyware, DDoS attacks. The online threat to companies, big or small and individuals too is large and growing. Around the world,  National Crime Agencies, Police Forces, Company SecurityTteamsare all fighting this menace – but they need more help. They need people like you. If you want the satisfaction of doing a rewarding job and if you want to make a real difference, learn cybersecurity and join industry!
</p>
 <h2> 3. A Variety of Industries to Choose</h2>
<p>As a cybersecurity professional you are not confined to a singular industry unlike a majority of the professional world. Digitalisation is taking place across a lot of industries. With advancements in the field of IOT, Big Data, Automation, and Cloud Computing we could say we are going through a Digital revolution. So being a cybersecurity doesn’t stop you from working in a hospital, school, government agencies, top-secret military agencies. The gates are wide open as almost everybody wants to be secure on the digital front.</p>
 <h2> 4. A Job that Never Gets Boring</h2>
<p>Due to the unpredictable nature of the future, a career in cybersecurity is not and cannot be static and stale. You will be challenged on a regular basis. There will be new and unexpected failures as well as amazing and surprising discoveries. One certainty is that attackers will continue to develop new exploits on a constant basis and it is your job to find creative, and optimized solutions to the arising problems. As a cybersecurity professional, you will be solving new puzzles, fighting off new demons, and supporting new activities on a regular basis. So if you tend to easily get bored due to things being monotonous, fret not, Cybersecurity never gets boring!</p>
 <h2> 5. A Chance to Work with Secret Agencies</h2>
<p>It’s certain that Cybersecurity Professionals have a clear shot at working with prestigious fortune 500 companies like Dell, Accenture, InfoTech etc, but the potential doesn’t end there. Experts who prove to be worthy of their skills might earn the chance to work with top-secret government agencies and intelligence agencies eg MI6, Mossad, NSA. So if you learn cybersecurity, you might just become a top-secret agent! </p>

 <h2> 5 benefits of learning Python</h2>
<p>Why? Several reasons, all of which you’ll understand once you’ve mastered Python. They are: </p>
 <h2> 1. Earning Potential</h2>
<p>Python is the second-highest paid computer language, according to Indeed. You can expect an average salary of $118,626 per year. Nothing to cry about. If you land a job with Elevano, you’ll earn the most. The average salary there is $162,223. Amazing!</p>
 <h2>2. Ease of Comprehension</h2> 
<p>Python is easy to learn and fun to use. Its syntax, unlike most computer languages, reads like English, so it isn’t stressful to pick up. It was named after Monty Python, so you know someone had a sense of humor developing this code and thus made it simple to use. It handles complexity nicely so you can focus on learning Python programming, not the hassles of details. And it’s free and open-sourced. Terrific!</p>
</p>
 <h2> 3. Flexibility</h2>
<p>Not only is Python easy to learn, but also it’s flexible. Over 125,000 third-party Python libraries exist that enable you to use Python for machine learning, web processing, even biology. Also, its data-focused libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib make it very capable of processing, manipulating, and visualizing data – which is why it’s favored in data analysis. It’s so accommodating; it’s often called the “Swiss Army Knife” of computer languages. </p>
 <h2> 4. What Jobs Call for Knowledge of Python?</h2>
<p> Once you’re experienced in the Python language, some of the jobs or careers where you can expect to find work are:

Software Engineer
Django Back-End Developer
Data Engineer
Django or Python Developer
Application Reliability Engineer
Full-Stack Developer
Keep in mind these are merely a handful of examples. There are many more opportunities and some of them will require knowledge of other languages, applications, and development tools.</p>
 <h2> 5. Python creates amazing graphics</h2>
<p>Coding sometimes gets a bad rap for appealing only to logical skill sets, but that could not be more wrong. 

Creative types enjoy using Python for its beautiful game graphics and its ability to generate new images using the deep learning we just mentioned. Python combines the meticulousness of coding with right-brained artistry—the best of both worlds. </p>

 <h2> 5 benefits of learning Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>Why? Several reasons, all of which you’ll understand once you’ve mastered Python. They are: </p>
 <h2> 1. Easy Implementation</h2>
<p> As the internet entirely manages Cloud Computing technology, it allows businesses to retain the present business applications and software without thinking much about backend technical glitches. A cloud infrastructure could be easily and quickly managed and accessed by the organizations.</p>
 <h2>2. Global Accessibility</h2> 
<p> This is one of the robust advantages which you get with the cloud. You can access your data from any place at any time. An internet bound infrastructure always maximizes the productivity of the organizations by ensuring global accessibility. This also allows very simple sharing and collaboration with multiple users in multiple locations.</p>
</p>
 <h2> 3. Building Collaboration</h2>
<p> Cloud Computing allows you to access, share and edit any documents anytime at anyplace. You, along with the employees can work on a single project from multiple locations by using Cloud Computing technology. Cloud-based workflow and sharing apps help you to make real-time updates and visibility in collaboration. This increase the growth rate of your business.</p>
 <h2> 4. Environment-Friendly</h2>
<p> Cloud Computing technology is not only beneficial for your business, but it is also an environment-friendly technology. Whenever your business needs scalability and Cloud need to fluctuate, your Cloud Server efficiently manages the ups and down. You only use the energy as per your requirements, so you don’t need to leave any oversized carbon footprints. This ensures that there is not any adverse effect on the environment.</p>
 <h2> 5. Cost Effectiveness</h2>
<p> Cloud Computing always cut down your expenses as there is no need to add any huge physical infrastructure to implement this technology. Also, the operating cost of Cloud is also very economical as compare to traditional technology because you only have to pay for what you require.</p>
